            I was first introduced to computer science at a young age by my %
            interest in computer games. At the time I was extremely interested %
            in how everything worked. I started programming with C\# using XNA %
            2.0, just shortly after its release. Mainly following tutorials, I %
            wrote some small interactive games (mainly 3D). After messing around %
            with XNA for a year or so I tried my hand at basic web development %
            (using SQL, Apache, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). While working with %
            web development I learned Java to try Minecraft modding, and then %
            eventually founded the Nonprofit which lead to me learning a much %
            broader range of general software development (C/++, CMake, OpenGL %
            and DirectX, etc). Generally, I have attempted to continue in %
            developing and teaching myself new programming languages, %
            optimizations, and methods to better hone my skills. For example, %
            recently I have been reading and messing around with ReactJS, %
            server side rendering, and offline first web development.%

             Over this past summer I worked at the University of California, %
             Irvine’s Office of Information Technology as Quality Assurance. %
             This job involved working with various products from UCI and %
             testing their functionality using Selenium. During the summer I %
             personally took their current workflow and redesigned it ground up. Their %
             previous testing suite was using Gherkin feature files with Cucumber %
             and then writing selenium-java code based off those files. This ended up %
             being at least 1000 lines of code per test. My solution is a modular, %
             data driven, and plugin based framework. Now, instead in java you %
             define “Processors” that read from JSON or Yaml and perform a set of %
             tasks. This allows for maximum code reusability and a test to now %
             be only a few lines of human-readable data objects. Furthermore a %
             slew of other features were added such as the ability to hook on %
             to specified events, defining “containers” to further increase %
             usability, and generating single file html reports.%

              Starting in 2010, I along with a couple others, founded a %
              Non-Profit Organization dedicated to distributing servers, mostly %
              game oriented. In its three year life span, we created a diverse %
              and popular server network working with a diverse group of people %
              from all over the world. My main role on the network was the %
              following: server maintenance, development of any custom software, %
              and training volunteer staff. We had dedicated servers hosted in %
              the Los Angeles and Texas data centers. The servers were then %
              hosting many VMs with various distros of linux. If and when any %
              custom software was needed for any of the servers, I was tasked %
              with developing it. This development ranged from simple auto %
              restart and permissions scripts to full on custom server software %
              (for example, when Starbound was released I reverse engineered %
              and rewrote their entire server architecture to be more stable). %
              Furthermore, I trained volunteer staff with varying knowledge %
              levels on topics such as basic linux usage, intro to programming %
              (Java), and basics of project management and version control using Git.%
